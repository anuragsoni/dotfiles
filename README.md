## Neovim

Pre-requisite: Vim 8+ or Neovim.

I use [neovim](https://neovim.io/), but the configuration here should also
work for vim8+.

Fish is a user-friendly command line shell.
[Functions](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html#tut_functions) for the shell configuration can be found in
